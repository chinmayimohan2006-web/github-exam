This repository is created for my Gitlab exam and i have got the 3rd experiment
first and foremost we have to create a file and add using git add command 
we commit the changes with the message so that  it will be easy for us to identify the changes 
next will clone remotly with our github repo URL
then we create a branch 
here i have created another branch names feature-branch where the chnages are made and aggain commited
next in 3rd experiment we use STASH wich saves the chnages temporarily that are not commited
